If you are running FreeBSD, you will need to do the following as root ('%'
represents a prompt):

    % ln -s /usr/include/db.h /usr/include/dbm.h
    % vi /usr/include/db.h
    [change "#include <db.h>" to "#include <dbm.h>"]

FreeBSD's libraries have 'db.h' rather than 'dbm.h', as most other
unix systems have it.  This change will break nothing, and will fix
most things.  The FreeBSD group is aware of this problem, and may fix
it in the future.
