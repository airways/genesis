Optimization/Cleanup:
    * overridable methods: change searching to take the first method
      found.  Do the check for !overridable methods at the time the method
      is set as !overridable, do not allow methods to be set as overridable
      if they are overriden on descendants.  Do not allow methods to be
      added if an ancestor defines it as !overridable.
    * file ops should use the builtin file descriptor functions
    * sanity checks are still not done, do them.

Changes:
    * Native methods
