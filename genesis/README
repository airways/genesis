INSTALL/COMPILATION

To compile simply type 'make'.

Installation is undefined as people generally move the binaries to
other locations.  Generally you should copy 'coldcc' and 'genesis' to
your world directory (wherever it may be).

NOTES

Verified to compile on:

    * FreeBSD 2.1-R and 2.1.5
    * DEC OSF/1 2.0 (Note: it will have problems on a DEC alpha processor)
    * DEC Ultrix 4.4
    * Sun Solaris 2.5

You will get the best results in FreeBSD, as it is the development platform
so possible problems are immediately found.
