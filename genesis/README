GENESIS

Genesis is the compiler and run-time interpreter/daemon for ColdC, and
is produced by the Cold Project.  You can learn more about helping to
support the Cold Project at:

    http://www.cold.org/support/

******** This is the Developmental release of    ********
******** Genesis and should be used with caution ********

Release information can be found in doc/CHANGES.  A list of tasks can
be found in doc/TODO.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL/COMPILATION IN UNIX

If you do not have an ANSI/ISO C compiler, give up or get GCC.  Genesis
is compliant to ANSI/ISO standards, but if your compiler does not (such
as the SunOS 4.1.x compiler) it may compile, but you will have serious
instability problems.

To compile simply type 'make'.

Installation is undefined as people generally move the binaries to
other locations.  Generally you should copy 'coldcc' and 'genesis' to
your world directory (wherever it may be).

The directory 'bin' contains a few useful scripts.

Full installation instructions can be found at:

      http://www.cold.org/Software/Genesis/

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL/COMPILATION IN WIN32

You will need an ndbm implementation in Win32.  You can get GNU's ndbm
implementation (gdbm) to cover this role.  You must first have access
to a unix system, with either bison or yacc.  Read doc/Win32-INSTALL
for full instructions.

NOTES

Verified to compile and run on:

    * FreeBSD (Any version after 2.0)
    * DEC OSF/1 2.0, 3.2
    * DEC Ultrix 4.4
    * Sun Solaris 2.5
    * Linux (although problems will arise 1.2.x versions)

You will get the best results in FreeBSD, as it is the development platform
so possible problems are immediately found.
