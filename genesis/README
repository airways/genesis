INSTALL/COMPILATION IN UNIX

To compile simply type 'make'.

Installation is undefined as people generally move the binaries to
other locations.  Generally you should copy 'coldcc' and 'genesis' to
your world directory (wherever it may be).

The directory 'bin' contains a few useful scripts.

NOTE: Because SunOS 4.1.x is not POSIX compliant nor even ANSI complaint
      there are certain problems that will arise in running Genesis on
      that type of system.  Unfortunately, they are serious problems
      which cause unstability in Genesis.  We suggest upgrading to
      a modern operating system.  NetBSD will likely run on your same
      hardware, and is free.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL/COMPILATION IN WIN32

You will need an ndbm implementation in Win32.  You can get GNU's ndbm
implementation (gdbm) to cover this role.

You must first have access to a unix system, with either bison or yacc.
Login to the unix system, untar the source, run configure, after it is
finished change directory to the 'src' directory and type 'make Win32'.
After this is finished tar (or zip) the resulting source tree and move
it to a Win32 platform.  You will need to edit src/include/defs.h and
change it so the __Win32__ definition is ENABLED (__UNIX__ will be by
default).  From there compile it within your favorite compiler.  You
may need to setup a project.  I'm not sure any Win32 make program will
have the same syntax as unix make, unless you have GNU make.

Basically, the source is compilable in Win32.  However, getting it to
a compiler and sequencing the compiler to link everything correctly is
up to you.

NOTES

Verified to compile on:

    * FreeBSD 2.1-R and 2.1.5-R
    * DEC OSF/1 2.0
    * DEC Ultrix 4.4
    * Sun Solaris 2.5

You will get the best results in FreeBSD, as it is the development platform
so possible problems are immediately found.
