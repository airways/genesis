INSTALL/COMPILATION IN UNIX

To compile simply type 'make'.

Installation is undefined as people generally move the binaries to
other locations.  Generally you should copy 'coldcc' and 'genesis' to
your world directory (wherever it may be).

The directory 'bin' contains a few useful scripts.

NOTE: Because SunOS 4.1.x is not POSIX compliant nor even ANSI complaint
      there are certain problems that will arise in running Genesis on
      that type of system.  Unfortunately, they are serious problems
      which cause unstability in Genesis.  We suggest upgrading to
      a modern operating system.  NetBSD will likely run on your same
      hardware, and is free.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL/COMPILATION IN WIN32

You will need an ndbm implementation in Win32.  You can get GNU's ndbm
implementation (gdbm) to cover this role.  You must first have access
to a unix system, with either bison or yacc.  Read doc/Win32-INSTALL
for full instructions.

Or by sending a mail message to majordomo@cold.org with a 'subscribe list'
line for each list.  For instance, if you wanted to subscribe to 'coldstuff'
and 'coldcore', your message body would be:

NOTES

Verified to compile on:

    * FreeBSD 2.1-R and 2.1.5-R
    * DEC OSF/1 2.0
    * DEC Ultrix 4.4
    * Sun Solaris 2.5

You will get the best results in FreeBSD, as it is the development platform
so possible problems are immediately found.
