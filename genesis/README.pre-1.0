This is the pre 1.0 release of Genesis.  The db syntax is _NOT_ what it
will be when we are finished!!!!

This driver is _ONLY_ for our own distributed developmental purposes.
We do not mind if people use it to play around, but be warned, the db
format will NOT be right, and will require some big overhauling to
convert to the final 1.0 format (read notes-format), and we dont have
the time to help you convert!

You have been warned (muahaha)

Also, this driver will not work with any db other than:

    * ColdCore 2.1

If you are trying to get others working, may the force be with you...

Known bugs/problems:

    * textdumping randomly leaves out objects after the db reaches
      a certain size, coldcore has an in-db dumping mechanism to
      get around this, as textdumping is being rewritten.
    * callers() causes a SEGV sometimes (but not always).  It is
      used in .debug() in coldcore, so you may want to remove this.
    * tasks() causes a SEGV most times.
