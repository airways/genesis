1.0-0  [17-Apr-96] Brandon Gillespie
      * Bug fix, "xxxx".native() caused a segmentation violation, the
        problem was mine, I wasn't cleaning up the stack correctly after
        completing a native method call.
0.4-4  [16-Apr-96] Brandon Gillespie
      * last function change to get the math functions to sit correctly,
        'log()' has been changed to 'dblog()', and the logarithmic float
        function is 'log()'.
0.4-3  [16-Apr-96] Brandon Gillespie
      * This release is 1.0 alpha
      * The following functions have been removed, because their native
        counterparts now work:
            hostname()
            ip()
            status()
            next_objnum()
            version()
            strftime()
            encode()
            decode()
0.4-2  [] Brandon Gillespie
      * Native methods
0.4-1  [] Brandon Gillespie
0.4-0  [] Brandon Gillespie
0.3-9  [8-Mar-96] Brandon Gillespie
        more, but I forget, lots of bug squishing
0.3-8  [20-Feb-96] Brandon Gillespie
      * changed bind_port() and open_connection() to use the current object,
        rather than specifying the object as a second argument.
0.3-7  [20-Feb-96] Brandon Gillespie
      * bug fixes, yipee
      * finalized command-line syntax
0.3-4~6 [Feb-96]: Brandon Gillespie
      * many bug fixes
0.3-3  [30-Jan-96]: Brandon Gillespie
      * completed file ops
            fopen()
            fstat() => [bytes,blocks,type,mode,owner,group,last access times]
            fchmod()
            fmkdir()
            frmdir()
            files() => (files in a directory)
            fremove()
            frename()
            fclose()
            fseek()
            feof()
            fwrite()
            fread()
            file() => (basic file info on the file bound to this object)
            fflush()
      * tinkered with textdb.c a bit, changed how 'name' directive works.
      * changed 'chparents()' to be object oriented (using 'this()' as the
        object parents are changing on).
0.3-2  [18-Jan-96]: Dancer
      * C functions write_long()/read_long()/size_long() replaced with
        non-byteorder caring functions -- they are a nice idea, but unstable.
        Someone should work on a solid version of these.
      * Fixed some problems in textdb.c (sometimes $root and $sys would
        get axed, hacked a more standard COPY def for strings.
      * crufted up panic()
0.3-1  [  -Jan-96]: Brandon Gillespie
      * Converted all occurances of 'dbref' to 'objnum' (respectively)
        For standardization with 'objname' (change 'dbref symbols to
        'objnum symbols).
      * function changes:
            get_dbref()       => lookup()
            next_dbref()      => next_objnum()
            todbref()         => toobjnum()
            [new]             => objnum()
            add_parameter()   => add_var()
            del_parameter()   => del_var()
            parameters()      => variables()
            compile()         => add_method()
            list_method()     => decompile()
                 (Note: these last two will eventually accept and
                  manipulate parse tree's)
            [changed]         => compile() (currently a null function)
            [new]             => get_method() (currently a null function)
            method_args()     => method_info()
            size()               (Now accepts data as well as nothing)
            data()               (returns all data on this, or you can
                                  specify an ancestor to get specifics).
            callers()         => stack()
            load()               (removed)
            echo()            => cwrite()
            echo_file()       => cwritef()
            [new]             => connection() (returns [readable,writable,dead])
            timestamp()       => (removed,
                                  replace with strftime("%d %h %y %H:%M")
0.3-0  [14-Dec-95]: Brandon Gillespie, Miroslav Silovic
      * Regexp didn't release reference to the integer pairs, causing a
        minor leak each time a match was called. Unfortunately, commands
        like @display and @show called regexp matches hundreds of times,
        resulting in bloat during intensive programming. (Miroslav)
      * textdb.c completed, mostly 1.0 format compliant.  Many changes are
        involved in this.
      * object names are now stored in the object structure as well as
        in the lookup table (for #num -> $name conversions) (Brandon)
          + add_objname(symbol, dbref) removed, is now set_objname(symbol)
            (for the current object).  For security, bind set_objname() to
            $root and have .set_objname() handle permissions.
          + del_objname() added, this will remove the object name.
          + objname() added.
0.2-10 [19-Nov-95]: Brandon Gillespie
      * cleanup of quick 2-9 release which had things wrong.  Also fixed
        a minor bug in dump.c (found by Gregory D Lewis
        <glewis@maths.adelaide.edu.au>).  Updated some of the note-*
        documents.
0.2-9 []: Brandon Gillespie
      * cleanup
0.2-8 [24-Oct-95]: Brandon Gillespie
      * Fixed buf_to_veil_packets() and buf_from_veil_packets()
      * Forgot to remove a temporary hack to fix a bug a while back.
        This was causing it to write an object to disk every time it
        was removed from the cache, not just when it was dirty.
0.2-7 [22-Oct-95]: Brandon Gillespie
      * Fixed a bug in execute.c, would SEGV if method access was
        anything other than driver or public and the driver called
        the method.
0.2-6 [21-Oct-95]: Brandon Gillespie, Miroslav Silovic
      * Added file base routines (Brandon).
      * Multiple connections to the same object are no longer allowed,
        an old connection is booted when a new one starts, on that object.
        This is a rare case anyway (due to bad coding in-db), and should
        be a transparent change (Brandon).
      * Found major memory leak in method_free (Miroslav).
0.2-5 [12-Oct-95]: Brandon
      * Fixed problems in argument handling with genesis, other
        cleanups (nice generic terminology).
0.2-4 []: Brandon
      * damn, forgot what I changed.
0.2-3 []: Brandon
      * Fixed long-time bug in lowercase and uppercase, they were calling
        prepare_to_modify, unnecessarily, which was causing problems.
      * Created ColdX Process Controller (control).  Control will
        be the process run, and will fork the driver or coldcc.  Once
        running, it will also connect to the driver (shared mem or
        pipes) for running blocked or forked tasks (name lookups and
        execute, for now).
      * Created coldcc, which will compile a binary db from text and
        will also decompile a binary to text.  This functionality will
        be removed from the driver.  Coldcc will also have added
        functionality.
0.2-2 [23-Sep-95]: Dancer
      * fixed many places where objects were not marked dirty and they
        should be.
      * fixed a bug in task scheduling (execute.c:task_delete())
0.2-1 [20-Sep-95]: Brandon, Dancer
      * Caching problems worked on, code by Dancer (help from Miroslav)
      * Pile allocation fixed (Dancer)
      * Bug in bind/unbind function fixed, uses symbols uniformely now
      * Changed data_tostr() literal strings (Brandon)

            "<list>"     ->    "[list]"
            "<frob>"     ->    "<frob>"
            "<dict>"     ->    "#[dict]"
            "<buffer>"   ->    "`[buffer]"

      * Fixed a bug with expression method evaluations and data
        references for objects, ala: "string".('explode)(); (Brandon)
      * fixed strfmt() bug (big evil one) (Brandon)
      * random cleanup (Brandon)
0.2-0 [11-Sep-95]: Brandon Gillespie, Miroslav Silovic
      * Added Floating Point support (Miroslav)
      * Fixed memory leak in match_pattern() (Miroslav)
      * New Function: method() (returns method in current frame)
      * New Function: backup(), similar to binary_dump(), but it copies
        the binary directory before making it dirty again.
      * Fixed bug with decompiling frob's
      * New Function: buffer_from_string() (newlines -> \n )
      * New Function: buffer_to_string()   (newlines -> \n )
      * Changed compiling escapes in strings.  Previously it would eat
        any single slash, and would escape the second character.  Now
        it does not eat the slash if the second char is not a double
        quote, or a slash.  This was causing a problem as you would
        have to submit regexp escapes as "str \\$object" rather than
        "str \$object" as they should be.  It works fine now.
      * Rearranged files in anticipation of adding object modules and
        native methods.
      * Added method states and method flags.  Method states can be one
        of the following:
            public              (default)
            private             (callable only by this)
            protected           (sendable only by this)
            root                (callable only by $root)
            driver              (callable only by the driver)
        Method flags can be any of the following:
            disallow_overrides  (same as before)
            synchronized        (will be used with multi-threading)
            locked              (method cannot be changed after this is set)
            native              (the method is native code, will come in later)
      * New Function: method_flags() returns the method flags as a list
        boolean integers.  This will change to a bitwise field, once
        bitwise operators are added.
      * New Function: method_state() returns the method state as a symbol
      * New Function: set_method_state() sets the method state
      * New Function: set_method_state() sets the method state
0.1-5 [7-Aug-95]: Brandon Gillespie, Miroslav Silovic, Jeff Kesselman
      * New Function: clear_var() (Brandon, Miroslav)
      * New Functions: localtime(), strftime() and timestamp() (Brandon)
      * New Function: buffer_tail() (Jeff Kesselman)
      * textdump read/write: ignores variables with invalid parents (Brandon)
      * New Functions: stat_file(), read_file() (Brandon)
        read_file() will eventually work the way it is supposed to,
        (line by line) rather than the entire file in one buffer (which
        is as it works now).
      * Added file management routines, seperate development source
        for developers, distribution source is a modified version of
        the development source.  (Brandon)
0.1-4 [16-May-95]: Brandon Gillespie, Miroslav Silovic
      * Fixed "E" in "aeiou" bug (Brandon Gillespie)
      * Fixed ugly nasty bug in function binding (Brandon Gillespie)
      * Fixed regexp bug, had backwards logic (Miroslav Silovic)
      * Signal handler now catches SIGCHLD and does what it should (so
        no more <defunct> processes, hopefully). (Brandon Gillespie)
      * Signal handler resets signals after each catch, for SYSV systems
        (I don't believe BSD systems need to do this, but I could be
        wrong).  (Brandon Gillespie)
0.1-3 [13-Mar-95]: Robert de Forest, Brandon Gillespie
      * assignments changed to expressions (Robert de Forest)
      * dynamic function binding (Brandon Gillespie)
        Before this change a select set of functions were hardcode
        bound to the system object.  Now, all functions are unbound
        and may be called by any object.  Two additional functions
        have been added (bind_function and unbind_function).  The
        function bind_function() accepts two arguments.  The first
        is a string representing a function to be bound.  The second
        is an object in the database to which the function will be
        bound.  The function unbind_function() accepts one argument,
        which is a string representing the function to be unbound.
        When a function is unbound it may be called by any object in
        the database.
      * signal handling cleanup (Brandon Gillespie)
      * To settle a long dispute, one set of function names were changed
        again:
            get_objnum()  =>   get_dbref()
            add_dbref()   =>   add_objname()
            del_dbref()   =>   del_objname()
            next_objnum() =>   next_dbref()
            toobj()       =>   todbref()
        Yes, this is redundant, lets hope its the last time.
0.1-2 [03-Mar-95]: Brandon Gillespie
      More cleanup, fixed some Signal problems for Linux
0.1-1 [02-Mar-95]: Brandon Gillespie
      Cleanup to configure script, added USE_GETRUSAGE flag
------------
0.1-0 [01-Mar-95]: Brandon Gillespie
0.0-3 [..-...-..]: Brandon Gillespie
      * added signal handler
      * changed main loop structure, previously:
             1. flush_defunct connections/records
             2. handle all input and output events:
                 1. [io]wait for something to happen
                 2. handle connection input and output
                 3. handle new and pending connections
             3. handle heartbeat
             4. run paused tasks
         now:
             1. flush_defunct connections/records
             2. [io]wait for something to happen
             3. handle connection input
             4. handle new and pending connections
             5. handle heartbeat
             6. handle connection output
             7. run paused tasks
       * changed a few function names:
             todbref()            => toobj()
             get_name()           => get_objnum()
             disconnect()         => close_connection()
             conn_assign()        => reassign_connection()
             run_script()         => execute()
             bind()               => bind_port()
             unbind()             => unbind_port()
             connect()            => open_connection()
             set_heartbeat_freq() => set_heartbeat()
             set_name()           => add_dbref()
             del_name()           => del_dbref()
             db_top()             => next_objnum()
       * added functions:
             status()   -- system status (man rusage)
             load()     -- system load, define CHECK_LOAD
                           in config.h to use.  Note: this
                           is not a good implementation.
             mtime()    -- microseconds (man gettimeofday)
       * fixed strsub() bug (strsub("", "", ""))
       * Random code cleanup and rewrites
0.0-1 [..-...-..]: Brandon Gillespie
      fixed some problems with configure and the server testing
      script

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ColdMUD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	0.12-1 (4-Nov-94): Brandon Gillespie / Alex Stewart
		Updated Documentation, created a baseline configure
		script, added bin/ and it's relative scripts,
		cleaned up file heirarchy.  Added write_err(),
		which goes to stderr (same as write_log before),
		write_log() goes to stdout and is (currently)
		only called in op_log().  Alex Stewart fixed
		compile warnings.  Major additions of this patch
		level include the file tree and the configure
		script system.

----
0.12 (unknown)
	Jordan took 0.11-4 (which included the 0.10-3 patches) and
	added suspend()/resume() and pause().

----
0.11 (unknown)
        Last source from Greg.  Includes removal of dict_del_elem(),
        dict_add_elem(), error_arg() and error_str() as well as added
        functionality to traceback().

----
0.10-3 (5/22/94)
        Bug fixes:
                (0.10-1) Loading DB error fixed (Robert de Forest/Crag)
                (0.10-1) Catches to mod by 0 and random 0 (Zachary)
                (0.10-2) ticks_remaining() added (Robert de Forest/Crag)
                (0.10-3) hostname() and ip() added (merlin)
                         bind() fixed (Greg Hudson)
                         dict error fixed (??)
                         LOG_TIMES added in config.h (Brandon Gillespie/Lynx)

0.10 (1/3/94)
	Bug fixes:
		(0.9-1) Error messages for some admin functions
		(0.9-2) Error checking in op_index() was wrong.
		(0.9-3) explode() didn't work on multi-character
			token separators.
		(0.9-4) Checking for changing root's parents in
			op_chparents() was wrong.
		(0.9-5) explode() now checks for 0-length separators.
		(0.9-6) tostr() on dictionaries was slightly broken.
		(0.9-7) echo() returned 0 instead of 1.
		(0.9-8) dict_del() was corrupting dictionaries.
		(0.9-9) Deleting an object didn't mark the db as
			dirty, although it modifies the db, so that
			you could have a "clean" database with missing
			objects.
		(0.9-10) data() was leaking object reference counts.
		(0.9-11) Frob keys in dictionaries could be lost.
		(0.9-12) class() was leaking dbref reference counts.
		(0.9-13) op_message() error used a discarded
			 identifier.
		(0.9-14) delete() was failing on sublists of lists.
		(0.9-15) While creating a dictionary, checking for
			 duplicates was faulty and could produce an
			 inconsistent hash table.
	Regular expression matching is now case-insensitive by
		default.  An optional third argument can be specified
		to make it case-sensitive.
	Whitespace is now stripped at the end of text-dump lines, so
		trailing tabs and spaces are irrelevant.  (This was
		biting a number of people.)  Also, unprintables are
		stripped from text dump lines.
	explode() now takes an optional third argument indicating that
		it should include blank tokens if there is a sequence
		of two or more token separators or if there is a token
		separator at the beginning or end of the string.
	Added error_str().
	Fixed some compatibility problems with compilation, and made
		it more palatable to compile under BSD 4.3.
	Started using SO_REUSEADDR to help with binding to the port
	random() is now 1-based.
	Added buffer type.  The 'parse' message now comes with a buffer,
		instead of with a line.  echo() takes a buffer instead
		of a string.
	Text dumps now write to "textdump.new" and rename onto
		"textdump", to avoid problems with machines crashing
		during text dumps.
	Now performing sanity checking to catch object reference count
		leaks.
	Dbrefs are now numeric; $foobar is a "name" which evaluates to a
		dbref.  The text dump format has a 'name' command to set
		names, and there's also set_name(), del_name(), and
		get_name().  The functions toint() and todbref() have new
		behavior.
	Added db_top().  It will go away in 0.11 or 0.12, though, so it's
		not documented.
	Added dict_add_elem() and dict_del_elem().

0.9 (November 25, 1993)
	Bug fixes:
		(0.8.1-1) Output wasn't being flushed on shutdown()
		(0.8.1-3) has_ancestor() wasn't working
		(0.8.1-4) Some minor uninitialized memory problems
		(0.8.1-5) A few fairly serious memory leaks
	Added match_regexp().
	Frob reps can now be lists as well as dictionaries.
	substring() changed to substr() for consistency
	The 'connect' message sent to receiver objects for ports now
		has two arguments, the remote address and the remote
		port.
	Added task_id()
	The 'connect' message sent to receiver objects for connect()
		now has one argument, the task ID which called
		connect().  The 'failed' message sent to receiver
		objects for connect() now has two arguments; the first
		is the task ID which called connect(), and the second
		is the error code of the failure.

0.8.1 (November 21, 1993)
	Bug fixes:
		(0.8-1) chparents(), destroy(), conn_assign() were
			leaking stack frames.
		(0.8-2) Reading in frobs from a text dump caused crashes

0.8 (November 15, 1993)
	Bug fixes:
		(0.7.1-1) .foo() was decompiling to this().foo()
		(0.7.1-2) Method search bug
	Added data().
	Changed frob construction syntax to <class, rep>.
	Added optional third argument to throw() and an error_arg() to
		retrieve it.

0.7.1 (November 12, 1993)
	Bug fixes:
		(0.7-2) Memory leak in discarding identifiers
		(0.7-3) Write buffer wasn't flushed before disconnecting
		(0.7-4) Crashes under Linux during text dumps
		(0.7-5) Compile-time portability problem with db.c
		(0.7-6) Crashes under Linux while traversing object db
		(0.7-7) Portability problems with NEXTSTEP
		(0.7-8) [@a, ...] optimization was buggy
		(0.7-9) Line counter failed on catch statement
		(0.7-11) union(foo, []) was leaking stack frames
	Rewrote lexer in C, to avoid lex/flex portability problems.
	Improved portability to SVR4 systems.

0.7 (November 2, 1993)
	Bug fixes:
		The delete() function was leaving its list in an incorrect
			state, causing memory corruption.
		A text_dump() immediately after another text_dump()
			resulted in a blank file, since the current search
			index wasn't getting updated.
		The current search index wasn't getting saved on binary
			dumps.
		Removing a method while it was running could have caused
			crashes.
		chparents() was crashing.  It also wasn't checking for
			empty parents lists, a security hole.
		The method search was scanning the parents in the wrong
			direction.
		replace() was mutating its list argument by mistake.
		String comparison was severely wrong wrt substrings.
		Dictionary comparison and frob comparison were wrong.
	binary/clean file now stores version number (along with current
		search index), so that the server won't try to load a
		binary database with a different version number.
	Revised documentation to reflect lack of pass-to, and made other
		improvements.
	this, definer, caller, sender now functions, not variables.
	Added sugar for '.foobar(...)' --> this().foobar(...), and for
		@[...] --> this()@[...] (s/@/$/p; see below).
	Optimized a = [@a, ...] (transparent to users).
	Frob start token changed from @[ to $[ to remove conflict with
		splice operator.
	Added uppercase(), lowercase(), case-sensitive strcmp(), and added
		size() to return the current object's size.
	Reorganized the database code to avoid including ndbm.h in a
		_POSIX_SOURCE'd file (was causing trouble on BSDi systems).

0.6 (October 16, 1993)
	Bug fixes:
		Type errors involving dictionaries and frobs were wrong.
		Case ranges failed badly, causing crashes
		Adding inappropriate values also caused crashes
		In fact, a lot of opcodes had this problem.  I've checked
			them pretty thoroughly and fixed a bunch.
	Added min(), max(), abs().
	Added connect(addr, port, dbref), starts connecting to a remote
		host.  dbref receives a "connect" or "failed" message
		when the connection finishes.
	Added heartbeat, and administrative operation set_heartbeat_freq().
	Eliminated pass-to from the server; only inspecific pass is
		supported.

0.5.1 (October 9, 1993)
	Bug fixes:
		Reading in dictionaries from a binary dump didn't set
			the reference count, causing crashes.
		Likewise duplicating dictionaries.
		A bug in the compiler was causing the decompiler to put
			`callers' at the end of variable declarations.

0.5 (October 6, 1993)
	Bug fixes:
		Some primitives (including setadd() and setremove())
			were corrupting lists.
		Error messages for index() and sublist(), and for
			getting an invalid object variable.
		Truth test for strings and lists was wrong.
		create() wasn't restricted to $sys.
		The directory "binary" didn't have x permissions.
		Line-number counting was wrong in some cases.
		rethrow() dumped core.
	Binary db output from dbpack.c is no longer binary, although
		ndbm is still icky that way, so no big deal.
	ancestors() is back in.
	Added union()
	Optimized more cases of 'foo = <expr including foo>' to avoid
		unnecessary copies.  (Especially helpful for the
		following.)
	Dictionaries.  #[[key, value], [key, value]] creates a
		dictionary.  dict["foo"] indexes into the keys.
		for i in (dict) iterates over the associations
		[key, value].  dict_keys(dict) retrieves a list of
		the keys.  dict_add(dict, key, value) returns a
		dictionary with an added key and value.
		dict_del(dict, key) returns a dictionary with the
		association for that key removed.
		dict_contains(dict, key) determines if a key exists in
		a dictionary.
	Frob representations are now dictionaries, not lists.
	Got rid of 'player'.  Also, 'sender' now refers to what 'caller'
		used to refer to.  'caller' now refers to the dbref of
		the object which defines the method which sent the
		message, and 'definer' now refers to the dbref of the
		object which defines the current method.
	connect and disconnect messages now get sent to the connection
		objects, rather than the system object.

0.4.1 (September 19, 1993)
	Lots of stupid bugs (including some compile-time bugs) fixed
		which got past me.

0.4 (September 19, 1993)
	Identifier usage is now local to objects, so the global
		identifier table doesn't grow with the database.
	dbrefs are now symbolic, not numbers.  You represent them with
		$foo, not #xx.  Where #-1 was used, 0 (the integer) is
		now used.
	toliteral() now does what tostr() used to.  tostr() now does
		translations more conveniently for some purposes.  In
		particular, dbrefs, symbols, and error codes get
		translated to their names as strings, not as literals.
		Strings are unaffected by tostr().  lists go to
		"<list>".
	The printed representations of non-identifier dbrefs, symbols,
		and error codes are now $"foo", '"foo", and ~"foo"
		respectively.  The parser can read this.
	Named arguments.  In addition to the 'var' declaration, there
		is an 'arg' declaration, which specifies the argument
		names.  "arg foo, bar, baz;" indicates three arguments
		named foo, bar, and baz.  "arg foo, [bar];" indicates
		one argument named foo, and then any number of arguments
		following it, which will be stuffed into a list stored
		in a variable named bar.  Method calls fail if you pass
		a method too few or too many arguments.
	Multiple server ports.  The command line currently takes one
		argument, a database directory.  The database is
		responsible for binding server sockets using bind();
		unbind() lets you unbind a server socket.  When you
		bind(), you give the server an object for handling the
		connections.
	Tracebacks improved.  An explanation string only shows up on the
		first line of the traceback, since the remaining messages
		are generally not useful, and serve mostly to make the
		lines too long.  Errors generated by throw() result in
		more understandable tracebacks now, I think.  rethrow()
		now takes only one argument (an error code).
	foo.bar is no longer an acceptable abbreviation for foo.bar().
	You can now append lists using the + operator.
	The case of 'foo = foo + whatever' is now optimized so that
		unnecessary string and list copies don't take place.  The
		case of 'foo = [@foo, whatever]' is not optimized,
		however.
	Binary database files are all in the directory 'binary', to
		allow for different implementations of ndbm.  I still need
		to redo the database layer myself, but that will wait.
	No more ancestor precedence lists.  (Purely internal change.)
	Added find_method() and find_next_method().
	Added a new data type, frob, and the built-in function class().
	Non-overridable methods.  Add a `disallow_overrides;' declaration at
		the top of your method and it cannot be overridden by
		children.
	Removed spew_method().
	If I didn't do this before, create(), destroy(), and chparents() are
		now administrative functions which take arguments.  setvar()
		and getvar() are now set_var() and get_var().  rmvar() and
		vars() don't exist any more; instead, there is add_parameter(),
		parameters(), and del_parameter().  Methods refer to variables
		through the parameters of the object the method is defined on,
		so the variable namespace is different for each ancestor of an
		object.

0.3 (July 29, 1993)
	Went to a global symbol table that grows in memory with the
		size of the database.  I may disk-base this in the
		future.
	Rewrote error-handling code.
	Default return value is now the current object's dbref,
		instead of 0.
	We now use a global identifier table.  Should improve speed
		signficantly.  It does mean that the process size grows
		with the db, though, albeit slowly.  I can make tradeoffs
		later if this becomes a problem.
	Binary database management is different now.
	version() now returns a number, not a string.
	Added toerr(), run_script().
	Split length() into strlen() and listlen().
	Added catch statement, critical expression, propagate expression.
	Added error(), traceback(), throw(), and rethrow().
	? : changed to ? |, since it was going to happen anyway.
	There's no longer a configuration file.  You can still use -p
		to specify the port number.  For now, the cache width
		and cache depth are hardcoded; they will hopefully be
		runtime-settable eventually.

0.2.1 (June 8, 1993)
	Fixed several bugs in binary dump reading, and got it to work
		with Linux.
	Fixed match_pattern() function.
	Fixed quoted wildcard matches in match_template() function.
	Fixed pad() function.
	Fixed setremove() function.
	Am now making sure to close the dbm file to force consistency.

0.2 (June 5, 1993)
	Fixed a bug in flush_defunct_connections() in io.c
	Fixed a bug in the decompiler in if-else unparsing, and another
		one in expr-message unparsing
	Fixed binary dumping
	Fixed strsub()
	Relaxed the requirement that compound statements and methods
		must contain at least one statment
	Fixed text dumps
	Added version(), random(), time(), ctime()
	echo_file() now looks in a "text" directory.
	--port is now -p
	-d option changes into a directory before running
	destroy() now reparents orphans to the destroyed object's
		parents.
	destroy() now returns E_PERM for system and root objects.
	Fixed an object reference count bug in object_find_method() in
		object.c.
	Fixed op_spawn(), which wasn't discarding an object reference
		count properly.

0.1 (June 3, 1993)
	Initial release
