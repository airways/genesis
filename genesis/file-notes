-- fopen()

This function is called with one or two arguments.  The first argument is
the name of a file.  The name may be restricted, depending upon if the
driver was compiled with restricted filenames.  If not, and the file does
not begin in a "/", the root text directory will be prepended to the file.

The second argument is the type of file to open.  If the type begins with
"<" or nothing, the file is opened for reading.  If the type begins with
">", the file is truncated to zero length or created for writing.  If the
type begins with ">>", the file is opend for appending.  If the second
argument is not specified, the type of file defaults to "<".

You can also place a "+" before ">" or "<" to specify read and write access
to the file.  Ending a type with a "-" sets it as a binary file, meaning
that input and output to the file is through buffers, rather than ColdC
strings.

If successful, the return value of fopen() is stat information in the
format returned by fstat().

Examples:

    stat = fopen("log", ">>");
    stat = fopen("/usr/home/test.info", "+>-");

-- fread()

Read from the existing file bound to this object.  If the file is a binary
file, a buffer is returned.  If the file is a text file, a string is returned.
In both cases, if the file is already at the end, the ~eof error is thrown.

With binary files an optional block size may be specified.  The default block
size is 512 characters.

-- fwrite()

Write to an existing file bound to this object.  The argument is either a
buffer (if it is a binary file), or a string (if it is a text file).  The
return value is an integer representing an offset value of characters which
were not written out (due to an error).  It should usually be zero.  Using
fwrite() with strings will always place a newline after the string.

[note: optional argument to terminate the string?]
