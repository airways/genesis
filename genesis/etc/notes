This is the STABLE release of Genesis.  This means no features will
be added to this release--only bug fixes and patches.  There is also
a higher level of run-time stability for this release which you will
not have with the DEV release (alpha developmental).

      * $time.format() fixed odd behaviour if zero-length string for
