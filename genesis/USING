This is an ALPHA 1.0 release!

If you are using a 0.4 database, you can upgrade easilly.  Dump your
database to text (coldcc -d), edit it and search for the following
functions, replacing them with their native counterparts.  Make sure
you have the objects in your database for those counterparts, and that
the methods they are using are not already defined:

      hostname()      =>   $network.hostname()
      ip()            =>   $network.ip()
      status()        =>   $sys.status()
      next_objnum()   =>   $sys.next_objnum()
      version()       =>   $sys.version()
      strftime()      =>   $time.format()
      encode()        =>   $http.encode()
      decode()        =>   $http.decode()

You will also have to update any calls to strfmt(), two changes to the
function have been made:

      1 - Data arguments are no longer specified in a list, instead
          they simply follow the format.
      2 - Formatting has changed, read the documentation at:

             http://www.cold.org/ColdC/Functions/strfmt.html

Known problems:

    * renaming a native method will cause mondo problems when you
      decompile it to text and try to recompile it back to binary,
      DO NOT DO THIS right now.

If you want to blow away any regular method definitions with their
native counterpart (such as $list.length(), etc) then you compile the
textdb using the '-f' flag to coldcc (force native methods to override
existing methods).  I would suggest examining each native method first,
they are listed in 'src/modules/moddef.h'
