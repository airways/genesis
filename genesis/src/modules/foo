Stages:

    1. compilation
    2. storage
    3. evaluation
    4. delivery
    5. formatting

ctext         = [element, [element, [...]]]
element       = control "." method "(" ... ")"
control       = frob | data
method        = eval_ctext | compile_ctext | decompile_ctext

Jeff:     {tag attrib=value:body}
Example:

    {list:
        {elem: {bold:This text} we should consider [time "%H:%M"]}
        {elem: {em:but this} is even more important}
    }

    The time is [time "%H:%M"].  Because it is [weather adjective] outside,
    we are canceling the class for today.  Have fun [weather activity]
    in the [weather name]!

Brandon:  <tag attrib=value>body</tag>
Example:

    <list>
        <elem><bold>This text</bold> we should consider [time "%H:%M"]
        <elem><em>but this</em> is even more important
    </list>

    The time is [time:12hr].  Because it is [weather:adjective] outside,
    we are canceling the class for today.  Have fun [weather:activity]
    in the [weather:name]!
