GENESIS

Genesis is the compiler and run-time interpreter/daemon for ColdC, and
is produced by the Cold Project.  You can learn more about helping to
support the Cold Project at:

    http://web.cold.org/

Release information can be found in doc/CHANGES.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL/COMPILATION IN UNIX

Genesis should compile on most ANSI/ISO C compilers. You will need
CMake, bison and either ndbm or gdbm's ndbm emulation.

To build:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

CMake contains generators for other build systems as well and they
can be used instead of make.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL/COMPILATION IN WIN32

You will need an ndbm implementation in Win32.  You can get GNU's ndbm
implementation (gdbm) to cover this role.  You must first have access
to a unix system, with either bison or yacc.  Read doc/Win32-INSTALL
for full instructions.

A copy of GDBM for Win32 can be found at:

      ftp://ftp.cold.org/cold/contrib/gdbm173s.zip

It is suggested that you try to find more current versions before using
this copy.
